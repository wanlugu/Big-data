# Online learning
1. Your data doesnâ€™t fit into memory
2. You expect the distribution of your data to morph or drift over time
3. Your data is a function of time (e.g. stock prices)
offline learning: batch
online learning: stochatic
# noSQL
document, graph, queries
# hadoop, spark
frameworks for data distributing and retrieving
hadoop focuses on diksed based and a map-reduced schema
both accommodate multiple types of data and by parallel workers


# mapreduce, multi-machine or multi-core in single machine
split into n subsets, assign to n machineas, then combine together, nx speed up
summation over training set
Limitation: only for batch, issue with small file, slow processing, latency, no catching, no real-time data stream, no delta iteration

# spark
Limitation: no file management system, no real-time processing, expensive (large store size), small file (store in zip, need uncompressed)
